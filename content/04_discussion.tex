\section{Theoretical calculations}
The calculations of the theoretical coincident muon event rate in section~\ref{sec:muon_coincidence} make for the most unambiguous part 
of the analysis. The resulting coincidence event rate, depending on the readout window can serve as a framework for future analysis on coincident events.

\section{Fixed Rate Trigger}
The analysis of the FRT data proved challenging.
